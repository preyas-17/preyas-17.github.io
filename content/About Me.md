## About Me

I am an Embedded Software Engineer with **3+ years of hands-on experience building production-grade embedded Linux systems** across FPGA-based SoCs and industrial vision platforms. My work sits at the intersection of **Linux kernel, BSP bring-up, FPGA workflows, and real-time multimedia pipelines**.

I specialize in taking hardware **from power-on to fully functional Linux systems**—owning everything from bootloaders and device trees to camera drivers, root filesystems, and performance tuning. I enjoy low-level debugging, upstream-quality engineering, and solving problems that span silicon to software.

---

## What I Do Best

- Embedded Linux board bring-up on **Xilinx Zynq & UltraScale+ platforms**
- Kernel, device tree, and U-Boot customization
- High-throughput **USB 3.0 & video capture pipelines**
- Yocto / PetaLinux BSP and SDK development
- Hardware–software co-design with FPGA acceleration
- Debugging complex system-level issues under real-time constraints

## Engineering Philosophy

I believe great embedded systems are built by engineers who:
- Respect hardware realities
- Write software that survives scale
- Debug patiently and methodically
- Care about maintainability as much as performance

If it boots cleanly, streams at line rate, and survives long-haul testing—I’m happy.
